# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

*It was difficult to figure out the symbols vs. string on my hash. Initially, I was having a hard time getting the values printed, as it was showing up as nil, rather than the value. It was a difference between putting the key in a symbol vs. string.*

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

*I didn't use note taking much on this challenge.. so far it hasn't been super helpful for me.*

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

*Googling. Looking for examples, youtube clips helped.*
